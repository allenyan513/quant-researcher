# Deep Research — single-stock deep dive

Build a deep-dive thesis on ONE ticker. There are **two layers**: the
deterministic core (facts from the `qr` warehouse) and the live context (today's
fast-changing world, from web search). Keep them separate — web search adds
context and narrative; it never overrides a `qr` number.

> **Invocation:** `qr` is a project script (`pyproject.toml [project.scripts]`).
> A bare `qr` is usually not on PATH — run it as **`uv run qr …`** from the repo
> root. The examples below write `qr` for brevity.

## Step 1 — Deterministic core (`qr`)

Each `qr` command prints exactly one JSON envelope; parse it, check `ok`, read
`data`. Run these for the one symbol (`SYM`):

1. `qr data freshness --symbols SYM` — if anything's stale, refresh the
   fundamentals in **one call**: `qr data refresh --scope all --symbols SYM`
   (only-stale by default; covers profile / quote / financials / ratios /
   estimates). Then pull the two scopes excluded from `all` (their own free
   sources): `qr data refresh --scope transcript --symbols SYM` (Alpha Vantage —
   soft-skips if unavailable), `qr data refresh --scope insider --symbols SYM`
   (SEC Form 4 via EDGAR), and `qr data refresh --scope short --symbols SYM`
   (FINRA short interest, free/auth-free). Don't `--force`; it spends FMP quota.
2. `qr research bundle SYM` — the structured base. Read:
   - `profile` · `latest_price` · `ratios_latest_annual` (incl. `roic`,
     `earnings_yield`)
   - `profile.stock_type` — `"bank"` or `"general"`; drives the §4 / §5
     report template fork below
   - **`scores`** — `template == "general"`: Piotroski F (x/9, with `missing`
     legs) + Altman **Z''** (zone). `template == "bank"`: both metrics are
     in `not_applicable` (conceptually broken on a deposit-funded balance
     sheet) — surface the `not_applicable_reason` honestly, don't try to
     interpret a "distress zone" verdict.
   - **`quality`** — `template == "general"`: `roic_wacc_spread`,
     `fcf_conversion`, `accruals_ratio`, multi-year margin / ROIC /
     revenue `trends`. `template == "bank"`: `roa` · `roe` ·
     `net_interest_margin` · `efficiency_ratio` · `equity_to_assets` +
     revenue trend. Tier-1 / NPL are NOT in the warehouse — they're
     listed in `quality.missing_fields`; supplement from filings if
     needed for the report.
   - **`income_statement_recent`** — for banks, each row additionally
     carries `revenue_net` (revenue − interestExpense). FMP's `revenue`
     for financials is gross (interestIncome + non-interest income);
     analysts publish net. **For a bank, headline `revenue_net` in the
     report — `revenue` is gross and will mislead.**
   - **`ratio_history`** — multi-year multiples + `latest_percentile_vs_history`
     (cheap/expensive vs the stock's own past)
   - `valuation_snapshots` · **`transcript`** (latest call: year / quarter /
     call_date / ~2000-char excerpt — for fuller speaker-segmented text +
     sentiment, read the `transcripts` table directly) · **`insider`** (recent
     Form 4 open-market buy/sell tally + notable trades) · **`short_interest`**
     (days-to-cover, short shares, Δ vs prior) · `news` · `holdings`
     (your position + cost basis, if any)
   - **`technical`** — ~1y price-action / SMA trend / RSI / MACD / volume
     snapshot plus a `signal_summary` (trend_bias · momentum_bias · macd_bias
     · near_52w_extreme). `null` when no daily_prices; `{"insufficient_data":
     true, "bars": N}` when N < 50 (rare — new IPO / freshly added to
     universe). Use this for §10 (tactical timing) only, **not** as a
     primary signal.
   - Any section is `null` when its data is missing — say so, don't invent it.
3. `qr earnings SYM` — actual-vs-estimate EPS/revenue surprise (only where an
   estimate exists — historical surprise is **sparse**; never imply a beat/miss
   without one) + any recorded ledger thesis/decisions.
4. `qr value SYM --model all` — DCF · PEG · multiples · **scenario** (bull/base/
   bear, probability-weighted FV) plus the DCF block's **`reverse`** (the growth
   the current price implies + `gap_vs_assumed` / `gap_vs_history`). Cite the
   `snapshot_id`s so the call can be replayed/graded later.

## Step 2 — Live context (concurrent web search)

Launch these as **parallel subagents** — one message, multiple Agent calls — so
they run concurrently and keep raw results out of the main context. Instruct each
to return findings **with a source URL each**, and to drop anything it cannot
source.

- **Analyst actions** — recent rating changes, price-target revisions, and new
  initiations on `SYM`.
- **Catalysts & events** — next earnings date; product launches, regulatory /
  legal items, investor days, and any near-term binary events.
- **Competitive / industry / expert color** — moat & market-share dynamics,
  channel-check / expert-call themes, industry tail/headwinds; the bull case vs
  the bear case.
- **Recent narrative** — material headlines over the last ~2 weeks, the prevailing
  narrative, and the credible contrarian take.

## Step 3 — Synthesize (output in chat)

Write a scannable, institutional-style deep dive **directly in the chat**. Do
**not** persist it unless asked (see Persistence). Every `qr` number is owned by
`qr`; every external claim carries a source link. Suggested structure:

1. **Snapshot** — name / sector / price / market cap, `as_of` + any data caveats
   from `notes`; your current position if held.
2. **Business & segments** — what drives revenue; TAM / growth drivers (web, cited).
3. **Moat** — durability via Hamilton Helmer's 7 Powers; competitive threats (cited).
4. **Financial quality** — branch on `profile.stock_type`:
   - **`general`** (default): ROIC vs WACC spread, FCF conversion, accruals,
     multi-year margin / ROIC / revenue **trends** (Phase 1 `quality`);
     Piotroski **x/9** + Altman **Z'' zone** — name any `missing` Piotroski
     legs honestly.
   - **`bank`**: ROA (~1%+ healthy) · ROE (~12-15% target) · Net Interest
     Margin (the warehouse uses total-assets as a proxy denominator for
     earning assets — slight over-estimate; ~3%+ strong) · Efficiency Ratio
     (lower better; <50% exceptional, 55-65% norm, >70% weak) · Equity /
     Assets (leverage proxy; ~10%+ well-capitalized). Do NOT cite Piotroski
     / Altman / FCF-conversion / ROIC-WACC for a bank — the bundle lists
     them in `not_applicable` with a reason. Surface `missing_fields`
     (Tier-1 / NPL) and supplement from filings only if the report needs them.
5. **Valuation** — branch on `profile.stock_type`:
   - **`general`** (default): lead with the **reverse-DCF expectations gap**
     ("price implies ~X% growth vs ~Y% assumed / historical") and the
     **scenario bull/base/bear** band; multiples **vs the stock's own
     history** (percentile) and vs peers. The forward-DCF point estimate
     runs on default assumptions and is unreliable — do **not** feature it.
   - **`bank`**: lead with **P/TBV** (book value ≈ tangible book for banks
     at scale — use `ratios_latest_annual.price_to_book`) + **PE vs own
     history** (percentile) + dividend yield. DCF on a bank degenerates
     ("no positive historical FCF") and the bundle reflects this — do NOT
     feature the DCF number; cite the warehouse `note` verbatim if present.
     EV/EBITDA is sector-gated and returns null for banks (deposits would
     blow up the equity bridge).
6. **Management & capital allocation** — buybacks / dividends / M&A; **transcript
   guidance + Q&A highlights** (Phase 3 — cite the specific call).
7. **Catalysts** — near-term events + the next earnings date (cited).
8. **Risks** — financial-quality flags (low F-score, weak accruals, distress-zone
   Z'') + web-sourced risks.
9. **Ownership / positioning** — your holding (`holdings`) + **insider activity**
   (`insider`: open-market buys vs sells, notable Form 4s) + **short interest**
   (`short_interest`: days-to-cover, short shares, Δ vs prior). 13F institutional
   ownership isn't ingested yet → source from the web if relevant (cited).
10. **Technical context / tactical timing** (supporting, **not** the primary
    signal) — read `bundle.technical`. Lead with the `signal_summary` line
    (e.g. *"trend up · momentum neutral · MACD bullish · not near 52w
    extreme"*); then a compact table of the three indicator groups:
    - **Trend**: SMA 20 / 50 / 200 with current price's % offset from each;
      the most recent 50/200 golden- or death-cross date (full-window
      lookback — these are rare events); most recent 20/50 cross within
      the last 60 trading days.
    - **Momentum**: RSI(14) latest + zone (oversold < 30 / neutral /
      overbought > 70); count of oversold / overbought touches in the last
      60 trading days.
    - **MACD**: line / signal / histogram + most recent 60-day golden /
      death cross.
    - **Volume**: 20-day avg vs latest, plus any volume-spike days
      (> 2× avg) in the last 30 — call these out **with the news
      headline** from `bundle.news` near that date when there's an obvious
      coincidence.
    If `trend_bias` / `momentum_bias` / `macd_bias` align on the same side,
    say so plainly ("three-way bullish confluence"); if they disagree, name
    the divergence. **Frame any read as timing context for the basics-driven
    thesis** — *if* the basics already justify a buy, technicals tell you
    *when*; they do not override §4 quality or §5 valuation. If
    `bundle.technical` is `null` or `insufficient_data`, write one line
    that explains why and move on — do not improvise indicators.
11. **Thesis & recommendation** — bull / base / bear and your conviction. Offer to
    record it: `qr ledger add SYM --side buy|sell --thesis "…" --confidence N`,
    citing the valuation `snapshot_id` so forward alpha can be graded later.

## Rules

- **`qr` numbers are the system of record.** Web search supplies context only —
  never restate a price, ratio, score, or fair value from search over the `qr`
  value.
- **Cite every external claim** with a source URL. If a search returns nothing
  credible, say so — never fill the gap with a guess.
- **Reverse DCF is the value-investor headline** (what growth the price bakes in).
  The plain forward DCF on default assumptions is unreliable — present valuation
  through the reverse read + the scenario band, not a single point estimate.
- **Technical signals are supporting context, not the thesis.** Use
  `bundle.technical` to answer *"if I were going to act on the basics, what's
  the tape saying about timing?"* — never to override the §4 quality / §5
  valuation read. When technicals and fundamentals point opposite ways, the
  fundamentals win and the divergence becomes a §10 observation, not a
  recommendation flip.
- **Be honest about coverage.** Surface `notes` from `qr earnings` / `qr value`
  verbatim; flag any `null` bundle section as missing data; name `missing`
  Piotroski legs; flag sparse earnings surprise; note the transcript `call_date`
  is a derived quarter-end placeholder (Alpha Vantage omits the exact date), and
  the transcript / insider scopes soft-skip when unavailable.
- **Persistence is opt-in.** Default is chat output only. Record a decision to the
  ledger (or save elsewhere, e.g. Notion) only when the user explicitly asks.
